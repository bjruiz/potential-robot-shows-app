#Brenda's Shows App

2024 v1.1

========

##Why was this my idea for an app?

I like to binge watch shows. I binge watch them so much sometimes I don't pay attention to the show 100% of the time (ADHD Brain and what not LOL) I kind of forget the title of a show or movie I have watched and will accidently rewatch the show or movie. This way I can keep track of the shows I would like to watch, what I have already watched, and the platform I watched them on. Just to keep track of everything.

##test
I get a show reccomendation from a friend or family member. I open up the app and add it to the 'Need to Watch' list/tab.
as well as adding the platform to watch the show or movie on.
That way when I need a show to play in the background I have my list in the app.
