dev of Shows App
----------------

I've been learning HTML, CSS, Python, Java, JavaScript, and SQL at the University of North Alabama! I have a Data Analysis Cert I graduate from UNA in December (really excited!!!) with my bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems. I created this app to keep track of shows you have watched or would like to watch in the future. I constantly forget what I have watched.
